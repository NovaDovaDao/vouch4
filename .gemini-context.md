# Gemini Collaboration Context

This document provides context and guidelines for the Gemini AI assistant to ensure consistency and efficiency while collaborating on the Alé project.

## Project Overview

-   **Project Name:** Alé
-   **Description:** A full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js (GraphQL) backend. The purpose is likely related to booking or membership management for gyms or similar facilities.

## General Rules & Directives

-   Please read this file before performing any task to ensure you are following the established conventions.
-   Always ask for clarification if a request is ambiguous.
-   Run tests and linters after making code changes to verify correctness and style.
-   When creating new files or components, follow the existing file structure and naming conventions.

## Tech Stack & Conventions

### Backend

-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Framework:** GraphQL Yoga
-   **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (Always use `pnpm` for package management in the `backend` directory).
-   **ORM:** Prisma
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Authentication:** `better-auth` (RESTful endpoints)
-   **API Style:** GraphQL SDL first
-   **Code Generation:** `graphql-codegen` for TypeScript types.

### Frontend

-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Framework:** React
-   **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (Always use `pnpm` for package management in the `frontend` directory).
-   **(More to be added)**

### General

-   **Monorepo Structure:** The project is structured as a monorepo with separate `frontend`, `backend`, and `landing` directories.

## Data Model Notes

-   **User Model:** The Prisma `User` model is the central authority for people. Both Staff and Members are `User` records.
-   **UserCategory:** The `category` field on the `User` model (an enum with `STAFF` or `MEMBER` values) is the primary differentiator between these two types of users.
-   **Specific Roles:** For `STAFF` users, their specific role at a given gym (e.g., Manager, Trainer) is defined in the `UserGymAssociation` join table.
